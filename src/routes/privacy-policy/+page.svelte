							Our Services may now or in the future integrate with social sharing features and other

							information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish

							Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting publicly to a

							have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by
							others. If you remove information that you posted to the social sharing service,
							copies may still remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or if other users or
							third parties, using the social sharing service, have re-shared, copied or saved that
							User Content.
